Feature: lead-po template — product-general PM role with consumer/framework fork

  @scenario_hash:6465b30fe62fb935 @bc:shopsystem-templates
  Scenario: lead-po template states that the PM role is product-general and its discovery inputs fork between consumer and framework instances
    When I read the lead-po template via "shop-templates show lead-po"
    Then the content states that the empowered-PM role is product-general — it instantiates into every product lead shop — and that market-facing PM competencies are load-bearing, not vestigial
    And the content states that the four disciplines are identical across product instances and only their inputs fork
    And the content states the consumer-product fork: full market-facing PM with real user, market, and JTBD discovery, competitive analysis, positioning, and segmentation, whose outcome is customer behavior change or business metrics
    And the content states the framework-as-product fork: platform-as-a-product or developer-experience PM whose customers are adopters, operators, and BC shops and whose outcome is adoption or developer experience
    And the content names the consumer product as the primary case and framework-as-product as the bootstrap or meta instance
