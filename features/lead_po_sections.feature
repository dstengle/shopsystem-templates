Feature: shopsystem-templates — CLI surface and role-discipline structure

  @scenario_hash:028a1a3b1f686b53 @bc:shopsystem-templates
  Scenario: lead-po template carries the structural sections that PO scope-and-vocabulary discipline depends on
    When I read the lead-po template via "shop-templates show lead-po"
    Then the content contains a "## Your default posture: COMMIT TO SPECIFICS" section header
    And the content contains a "## Sufficiency check — authoring a scenario" section header
    And the content contains a "## Sufficiency check — responding to a `clarify`" section header
    And the content contains a "## Anti-rationalization" section header
    And the content contains a "## Reporting back" section header
