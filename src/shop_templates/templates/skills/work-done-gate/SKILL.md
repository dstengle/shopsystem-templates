# Work-Done Gate

## Overview

Before any `work_done --status complete` emission, run this gate. Three checks must all pass. Any single failure converts the emission to `work_done --status blocked` with named evidence — no exceptions, no partial passes.

This gate is the enforcement point for ADR-010 and the integration contract. It is not optional.

## The Three Pre-Emit Checks

### Check 1: Clean Working Tree

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**Pass:** output is empty (no modified, staged, untracked, or deleted files).

**Fail:** any output from `git status --porcelain`.

Evidence on failure: show the full `git status --porcelain` output. Name the dirty paths. Block with message:
```
blocked: dirty working tree at emission time. Paths: <list from git status --porcelain>
```

A dirty tree at `work_done` time means uncommitted work may be present. The BC must commit or discard all changes before emitting.

### Check 2: work_id Commit Reachable from `origin/main`

```bash
git fetch origin
git log origin/main --oneline | grep <work_id>
```

**Pass:** `grep` finds the work_id substring in at least one commit on `origin/main`.

**Fail:** `grep` returns no match.

Evidence on failure: show the current `origin/main` HEAD SHA and the work_id searched for. Block with message:
```
blocked: work_id <work_id> not reachable from origin/main (HEAD: <sha>). Run integrating-to-main.
```

**Why `git fetch origin` first:** the local ref `origin/main` may be stale. Fetching before the check ensures the gate sees the actual remote state. Skipping the fetch is a false pass.

The attribution mechanism: the work_id substring must appear in the commit subject or body. Tags and `git notes` are also acceptable, but the `git log --oneline | grep` form is the canonical check.

### Check 3: Scenario Hash Integrity (ADR-010)

ADR-010 rule: `work_done.scenario_hashes` must be a **subset** of the `@scenario_hash:` tags actually pinned in the BC's `features/`.

Three sub-steps:

**3a. Recompute hashes.**
```bash
scenarios hash features/<scenario_file>.feature
```
Recompute the canonical hash for each scenario you intend to include in `work_done`. Do not trust hashes from memory or prior conversation turns.

**3b. Confirm presence via git grep.**
```bash
git grep "@scenario_hash:<hash>" features/
```
Each hash you intend to report must appear in the committed `features/` tree. If a hash is not present in `features/`, it was never pinned — you cannot claim it.

**3c. Enforce subset rule.**
The set of hashes you pass to `--scenario-hashes` must be a strict subset of the hashes found in `features/`. You may report fewer than all pinned hashes (partial delivery is valid); you must not report a hash not in `features/`.

**Pass:** all three sub-steps pass for every hash in the intended `work_done` payload.

**Fail:** any hash not found via `git grep`, or any hash whose recomputed value does not match.

Evidence on failure: name the mismatched or missing hash, the path searched, and the `origin/main` short SHA. Block with message:
```
blocked: scenario_hash <hash> not found in features/ (searched: features/; origin/main: <sha>). Scenario may not be pinned.
```

## Gate Summary Table

| Check | Command | Pass condition | Fail → blocked evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clean working tree | `git status --porcelain` | empty output | dirty paths list |
| work_id reachable | `git fetch origin && git log origin/main --oneline \| grep <work_id>` | grep matches | work_id + origin/main HEAD SHA |
| Scenario hash subset | `scenarios hash` + `git grep` | all hashes in features/ | mismatched hash + path + SHA |

## Failure Converts Complete to Blocked

When any check fails, do not emit `work_done --status complete`. Emit:

```bash
shop-msg respond work_done \
  --bc <name> \
  --work-id <work_id> \
  --status blocked \
  --message "<named evidence from the failing check>"
```

Named evidence means: specific paths, the work_id value, the `origin/main` short SHA, and the specific check that failed. Vague evidence ("something went wrong") is not acceptable.

## After Resolving a Block

Fix the underlying cause (clean tree → commit or discard; unreachable commit → run `integrating-to-main`; hash mismatch → pin or correct the scenario), then re-run the full gate from Check 1. Do not skip checks that previously passed — run all three again.
