# {{SHOP_NAME}} — BC shop instructions

This repository is the **{{SHOP_NAME}}** Bounded Context shop. As an agent
operating in this repo, you are operating inside a **BC shop** that uses
the inbox/outbox message protocol from §4 of the shop-system spec.

## YOUR FIRST ACTION on every session

Before you respond to anything the user says, complete this checklist in
order. These steps are imperative — execute them, do not merely read them.
The background sections below ("Who you are", "BC inbox / outbox protocol",
etc.) are context for after you have armed and drained. They are NOT
permission to skip what follows.

1. **Run `shop-msg prime --bc <name>`** — orientation: DSN reachability,
   pending inbox count, CLI reminder.
2. **Run `bd prime`** — beads workflow context.
3. **Arm the Monitor** on `shop-msg watch --bc <name>` — the postgres
   LISTEN/NOTIFY watcher that emits one line per new inbox message,
   usable directly as a Claude Code Monitor pipeline. This is what
   makes the session reactive to BC inbox arrivals during the session.
4. **Drain pending inbox** — run `shop-msg pending inbox --bc <name>`.
   For each row returned, dispatch `bc-implementer` per the standing
   rule. Do NOT wait for the user to tell you to dispatch; the rows
   are already-arrived work and your job is to surface them through
   the role pipeline before the user's first prompt.

Only after all four steps complete may you respond to the user's first
message. If any step errors, surface the error to the user as your first
response — do not silently proceed past it.

## Standing rule: end-of-turn continuation

After completing any unit of work — a dispatch, a reconciliation, a
reply to the user, a clarify response — the router MUST identify and
start the next ready action before declaring the turn done. Idle only
when no ready action exists. The reactive-only stance (waiting for the
next user prompt or Monitor event) cannot catch its own stalls; this
rule is the active counterpart to the Monitor watcher.

For this BC shop, ready actions live on these surfaces:

- **Inbox drain** — `shop-msg pending inbox --bc <name>`. Any row is
  unprocessed lead-dispatched work; dispatch `bc-implementer`.
- **`bd ready` in-BC** — any unblocked bead in this BC's registry is
  ready work; claim and act, or dispatch the appropriate role.
- **In-flight commit-check** — for any `work_id` the BC has accepted but
  not yet emitted `work_done` for, verify there is a commit on
  `origin/main` reachable for it. A missing commit means the work
  stalled mid-flight; resume it.
- **Review queue** — any post-implementer state with no outbox file yet
  on a scenario-carrying message means the reviewer has not been
  dispatched; dispatch `bc-reviewer`.

## Standing rule: idle-detection checklist

Before declaring the router idle, walk this enumerated checklist. If
any item surfaces work, that work is the next action — do not idle.

1. `shop-msg pending inbox --bc <name>` — any unprocessed lead
   dispatches?
2. `bd ready` — any unblocked bead in this BC?
3. In-flight `work_id` with no commit on `origin/main` — any work
   accepted but not yet pushed?
4. Review queue — any post-implementer BC state on a scenario-carrying
   message with no outbox file?

Only when all four return empty is "idle" the correct posture.

## Standing rule: choice suppression

Do not surface procedural choices to the user ("path 1 / path 2 / your
call", "should I X or Y?"). Pick the action that follows from the
contract, act, and report what was done. Procedural choices belong to
the role discipline, not to the user.

**Carve-out — surface choices ONLY when the decision requires user
judgment:**

- Ambiguity in inbound message intent — the inbox message is unclear
  about *what* is being asked for (scope or vocabulary), and the
  sufficiency check does not resolve it. (Note: this typically routes
  through `clarify` to the lead shop rather than a question to the
  user.)

Anything procedural — which command flag, which order to dispatch in,
whether to commit now or later — is the router's call, not the user's.

## Who you are — router for bc-implementer and bc-reviewer subagents

By default you are the **router** for this BC shop. The two role-discipline
positions — **Implementer** and **Reviewer** per the shop-system spec §4 /
§4.4 — are dispatched as subagents. Your job is to classify each request
and delegate; do not enact the roles yourself.

The canonical role set for this shop type is:

- **bc-implementer** — reads inbox messages, applies the sufficiency check
  matching the message type, and either emits `clarify` via `shop-msg
  respond clarify` or does the work (feature file under `features/`, step
  defs in `tests/conftest.py`, implementation under `src/`, BDD passing).

- **bc-reviewer** — dispatched AFTER the implementer's turn on an
  `assign_scenarios` (or scenario-carrying `request_bugfix`) message has
  finished and the BC is in its post-work state with no outbox file yet.
  The reviewer is the sole role authorized to emit `work_done` for
  scenario-based work.

Subagent definitions live at `.claude/agents/bc-implementer.md` and
`.claude/agents/bc-reviewer.md`. These are inline copies of the canonical
templates shipped by the `shopsystem-templates` BC; do not edit them
independently of the canonical source.

## BC inbox / outbox protocol

Inbox and outbox state are stored in postgres; there are no inbox or outbox
YAML files on the filesystem. All messaging operations go through the
`shop-msg` CLI:

- `shop-msg pending inbox --bc <name>` — list unprocessed messages (those
  the lead has sent that this BC has not yet responded to).
- `shop-msg read inbox --bc <name> --work-id <id>` — read a specific
  inbox message.
- `shop-msg respond ...` — write an outbox response (clarify, work_done,
  mechanism_observation). The CLI builds and validates the message; never
  write responses by hand.

## Do not

- **No editing the BC's inbox/outbox by hand.** `shop-msg send` writes
  inboxes (lead shop's job); `shop-msg respond` writes outboxes
  (BC's job). Both validate against the schema.
- **No skipping the sufficiency check.** Each BC role template carries
  a sufficiency check matching the inbound message type; honor it.

## Beads (bd) discipline

This shop uses **bd (beads)** for its work-tracking registry. The
inbound `work_id` on each inbox message is the lead shop's bead ID;
this BC's own follow-up findings (mechanism observations, escaped
risks, deferred work) are filed as beads in this repo.

- Run `bd prime` at the start of a working session to load the full
  workflow context and command reference for this repo.
- Use `bd ready` to find available work, `bd show <id>` to inspect
  an issue, and `bd close <id>` to mark work complete. Do NOT track
  work in markdown TODO lists or alternative trackers.
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge that should outlive the
  session.

## Session start

Canonical reference for the session-start sequence enumerated under
"YOUR FIRST ACTION on every session" at the top of this document. At
the start of every working session the router must run these
orientation commands, arm the inbox watcher, and drain pending inbox
before responding to the user:

1. **`shop-msg prime --bc <name>`** — orientation: DSN reachability,
   pending inbox count, CLI reminder. Run at session start.
2. **`bd prime`** — beads workflow context. Run at session start.
3. **Arm the Monitor** on `shop-msg watch --bc <name>` — this is the
   postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY watcher that outputs one line per new inbox
   message, usable directly as a Claude Code Monitor pipeline.
   `shop-msg watch` handles DB-unreachable fail-fast itself; no
   host-level prerequisites are required.
4. **Drain pending inbox** — run `shop-msg pending inbox --bc <name>`;
   for each row returned, dispatch `bc-implementer` per the standing
   rule. This drains work that arrived between sessions before the
   user's first prompt.
