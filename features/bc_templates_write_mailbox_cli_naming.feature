Feature: each canonical template's write-mailbox subsection names its shop-msg respond CLI per step

  @scenario_hash:942895d284cf0ec7 @bc:shopsystem-templates
  Scenario Outline: each canonical template's write-mailbox subsection names its "shop-msg respond" CLI per step, so a future edit cannot regress a respond action to a bare "send the response" while only template-wide scenarios gate it
  When I read the "<template>" template via "shop-templates show <template>"
  And I locate the subsection that begins with the heading "<heading>" and ends at the next heading of depth two (##) or depth three (###), whichever comes first
  Then within that subsection, every numbered step whose action is responding into a mailbox names the literal substring "<respond_cli>" on the same step
  And within that subsection, no numbered step describes responding into a mailbox using a bare action verb — "send", "emit", "post", "write", "reply", "drop", or a bare path-shaped reference such as "outbox/", "inbox/", or "the response file" — without naming the literal substring "<respond_cli>" on the same step

  Examples:
    | template        | heading                                              | respond_cli                          |
    | lead-architect  | ### Responding to a BC clarify via shop-msg respond  | shop-msg respond clarify             |
    | lead-po         | ### Responding to a clarify via the shop-msg CLI     | shop-msg respond clarify             |
    | bc-implementer  | ## Your job                                          | shop-msg respond work_done           |
    | bc-implementer  | ## Surfacing mechanism observations                  | shop-msg respond mechanism_observation |
    | bc-reviewer     | ## Outcomes                                          | shop-msg respond                     |
