Feature: lead-architect 'Responding to a BC clarify' subsection names shop-msg read outbox per step

  @scenario_hash:e6bdf2f33bfae0d1 @bc:shopsystem-templates
  Scenario: lead-architect template's "Responding to a BC clarify" subsection names "shop-msg read outbox" on every step whose action is reading the BC's outbox, never relying on a surrounding clause
  When I read the lead-architect template via "shop-templates show lead-architect"
  And I locate the subsection that begins with the heading "### Responding to a BC clarify via shop-msg respond" and ends at the next heading of depth two (##) or depth three (###), whichever comes first
  Then within that subsection, every numbered step whose action is reading the clarify from the BC's outbox names the literal substring "shop-msg read outbox" on the same step
  And within that subsection, no numbered step describes reading the BC's outbox using a bare action verb — "open", "cat", "ls", "grep", "inspect", "view", "edit", "tail", "head", or a bare "Read" — without naming the literal substring "shop-msg read outbox" on the same step
  And within that subsection, no numbered step refers to the BC's outbox by a path-shaped reference such as "outbox/", "<BC root>/outbox/", or "the outbox file" without naming the literal substring "shop-msg read outbox" on the same step
